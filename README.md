# basic-tls
This project is studying and implementing a TLS.

## Configuration
If you want to use the basic-tls, you have to clone it from Github. You also need to have Docker in your system. After the previous requirements finish, you move to `/docker`. Next, you have to execute `docker-compose up -d` which makes the running container of the basic-tls. Finally, you can access the running container by using vscode's docker and remote tool extensions. Have a enjoy!

If you want to delete the container, you have to run `docker-compose stop`.
